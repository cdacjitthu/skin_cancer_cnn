# Skin cancer classification
## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
   - Multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.
- What is the background of your project?
    - To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    - A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
